                            <p id="vows-text-1">Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of eternal passion. That is just being "in love," which any fool can do. </p><blockquote>Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.</blockquote><p id="vows-text-2">Those that truly love, have roots that grow towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms have fallen from their branches, they find that they are one tree and not two.

                            At the risk of sounding cheesy (though today is the day for cheesy, if there ever was one), I knew as soon as I met you that you were going to be part of my life. <br><br>On a perfectly sunny day in a beer garden in North London, you were miles from home in a part of town you never came to, but somehow we wound up sitting opposite each other at a picnic table talking the best kind of rubbish.<br><br>
                            
                            I was only a few months away from leaving the UK to come home, so I wasn’t on the lookout, didn’t expect to meet anybody, but there you were. You had a totally weird sense of humour, took my banter and ran with it, and I remember having so much fun. I knew right away that you were “my person”. <br><br>
                        
                            Even though loving someone who is from the other side of the planet is logistically challenging, we have done it for ten and a half years! Through the credit crunch, his & hers redundancies, too many months of long distance, moves from London, to Perth, to Sydney, to Auckland, and many bouts of homesickness in between, we have done it… <br><br>There were some times when it might have seemed easier to give in to distance, but we always carried on and made our way home to each other. That’s how I know that you will always be “my person”.<br><br>
         
                            John, I love your little “isms”. I love your affinity for the weird and ridiculous and the imagination with which you approach everything.
                            I love the strange little language we speak at home, which we know that no one else could ever really ‘get’.<br><br>
                            I love it when you really, properly laugh at a silly joke I crack.
                            I love the way you rein me back in when I need it, and let me get away with some things, too.
                            I love that you have made New Zealand your home and that you are such a part of my family, and that you understand how important family is to me.<br><br>
                            There are so many little and big things you do that make me feel safe, supported, accepted and loved. I am so lucky to have found you.<br><br>
     
                            So I promise that for the rest of our lives
                            I will laugh with you, and at you when necessary
                            And I will try not to take myself too seriously either
                            I’ll try to avoid cooking mashed potato too often.<br><br>
                            I will try to wait until you’re out to watch Gilmore Girls
                            I will never decline an offer to ‘hug it out’ after a disagreement
                            I will stand next to you when you face scary things
                            I will be honest with you, even when it’s hard
                            I will remind you of all the awesome things you are capable of when you have forgotten.<br><br>
                            And I will always be what home means for you, wherever we go in life.
                            I love you.<br><br>

                            <p id="vows-text-john">Steph, einahpets, special piece of pie. <br><br>From origami dinosaurs to little baked bean toes, to the lightest kiss in the world and going to the moon.
                            We've definitely had some adventures together.<br><br>
                            The fact we're here now, after the time you wore a pink, fluffy visor and I played you songs about an English rapper knocking someone out might baffle a few people, but not me.<br><br>
                            I haven't seen you in any visors lately, but those song lyrics made their way into our daily dialogue. <br><br>
                            It was quite clear to me early on that you were very silly, which was great because silliness is my forte.
                            It forms the foundation of our entire relationship and I wouldn't want it any other way.<br><br>
                            The fact that we can still laugh about things that happened 10 years ago proves we're still as well matched as the day we met.<br><br>
                            I'm super glad I've found my little weirdo to talk trash to, sing little songs and do nothing with. I have found the most beautiful person in the world in the most beautiful place in the world. <br><br>Not to mention that epic hair you have, I could live in there. You taught me it's ok to walk bare feet to the shops.<br><br>
                            We do have our differences though, I still can't understand why you don't think that episode of peep show isn't funny. But that's alright, everyone deserves one free pass.<br>
                            We've been on some epic journeys together and I know it is only the beginning.<br><br>
                            I promise to tell you when your outfit doesn't have enough contest, I promise they'll be plenty of hugs, and many more adventures to come. I'll always go in to bat for you no matter what. <br><br>I'll be the spaghetti to your meatballs, the sea to your weed, the symphony to your orchestra, the jelly to your ice cream, the rice pop to your little honey jacket, the Simon to your Garfunkel, the Stewie to your Brian, the rotisserie to your chicken, the bridge to your chorus, the snow to your mountain peak, the rock to your roll and the the milk to your cookies. <br><br>Oh, I'll try to learn to swim, as long as you learn to drive.<br><br></p>
